      <p>Cameras with interchangeable lenses offer three primary settings that affect how a photograph is exposed when
        the shutter button is pressed. These are <mark>aperture</mark>, <mark>shutter speed</mark>, and <mark>sensitivity</mark> (also called
        &ldquo;<mark>ISO</mark>&rdquo;) and are often referred to collectively as the &ldquo;<mark>exposure triangle</mark>.&rdquo; Each setting
        impacts the brightness of a photograph while also providing its own unique impact. This guide will focus on
        aperture.</p>

      <p>The aperture setting, called an <mark>f-number</mark>, is usually expressed like this: &fnof;/11. The f-number is what
        fraction of the <mark>focal length</mark> the aperture diameter represents. A &fnof;/2 aperture has a diameter equal to
        &frac12; of the focal length, and a &fnof;/8 aperture has a diameter equal to &frac18; of the focal length. So
        as the aperture diameter decreases, the f-number increases.</p>

      <p>F-numbers are not a continuous linear scale. The standard sequence of f-numbers is &fnof;/1, &fnof;/1.4,
        &fnof;/2, &fnof;/2.8, &fnof;/4, &fnof;/5.6, &fnof;/8, &fnof;/11, &fnof;/16, and &fnof;/22; but note that some
        lenses have numbers between these. These ratios have a specific mathematical relationship to each other in terms
        of how much light passes through the aperture. Each number in the standard sequence lets in half the light of
        the previous number, so an aperture set to &fnof;/2.8 will let in twice as much light as it would when set at
        &fnof;/4. A smaller f-number indicates a larger aperture which lets in more light, while a larger f-number
        indicates a smaller aperture, which lets in less light.</p>

      <p>Since a smaller aperture lets in less light, it will result in a darker photograph. What is not as obvious is
        that a smaller aperture also causes more of your photograph to be in focus. In landscape photographs, objects
        far away from the camera are in focus, while in portrait photographs, it is common to see distant objects behind
        the subject that are out of focus. This difference is an effect of different aperture sizes. The range of
        distances that are in focus are referred to as the <mark>depth of field</mark>.</p>

        <figcaption>
          As the size of the aperture decreases, the f-number increases. More of the photograph is in focus at smaller
          apertures, but the photograph is darker overall.

      <h2>Aperture in action</h2>

      <p>Most cameras have two primary modes that allow the aperture to be set: <mark>aperture priority</mark> and <mark>manual mode</mark>. In
        aperture priority mode, you control the aperture, and the camera calculates an optimal shutter speed and
        sensitivity (also called &ldquo;ISO&rdquo;) setting. In manual mode, you control all the exposure settings,
        and changing aperture does not automatically change the other settings.</p>

      <p>In the photographs below, there are seven colored objects lined up in a row with equal spacing. The white
        object in the center of the row is what the camera was focused on.</p>

      <section id="priority" class="nav-target">
        <h3>Aperture priority</h3>

        <p>In the images below, the aperture was set differently for each photograph. Then the camera automatically
          selected a shutter speed and sensitivity (ISO). Note how the background becomes more in focus as the f-number
          is
          increased.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>

      <p>Aperture is one of the key camera settings that affects your photography. As the aperture decreases, the
        amount of light reaching the camera sensor decreases, so your photo will be darker, but more of your subject
        will be in focus.</p>

      <p>An f-number is the ratio of lens&rsquo; focal length to the diameter of the aperture. A larger f-number means
        a smaller aperture. The standard sequence of f-numbers is &fnof;/1, &fnof;/1.4, &fnof;/2, &fnof;/2.8,
        &fnof;/4, &fnof;/5.6, &fnof;/8, &fnof;/11, &fnof;/16, and &fnof;/22. Each progressively larger f-number in the
        standard sequence lets in half as much light as the previous one.</p>

      <p>The two most common camera modes for aperture control are aperture priority and manual mode. In aperture
        priority, you set the f-number, and the camera calculates an optimal shutter speed and sensitivity. In manual
        mode, you control shutter speed and sensitivity in addition to aperture.</p>
